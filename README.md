# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

## Project Overview
This project focuses on improving fraud detection for both e-commerce transactions and bank credit card transactions. The goal is to build reliable machine learning models that can accurately identify fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Fraud detection is a critical problem in financial technology, as undetected fraud leads to financial losses, while incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions harms user experience. This project adopts a data-driven and business-aware approach to address these challenges.

## Datasets
The project uses three datasets:

- **Fraud_Data.csv**  
  E-commerce transaction data containing user information, transaction details, device data, and a fraud label.

- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**  
  Maps IP address ranges to countries, enabling geolocation-based fraud analysis.

- **creditcard.csv**  
  Bank transaction data with anonymized features and highly imbalanced fraud labels.

## Project Status
🚧 **Current Stage: Interim-1 (Data Analysis & Preprocessing)**  
At this stage, the project focuses on:
- Understanding the datasets
- Cleaning and preprocessing data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Initial feature engineering

Modeling and explainability will be implemented in later stages.
